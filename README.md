# Crunchbase Companies Funding Analysis using-python-and Power BI

## **Introduction**
In this project, I set out to uncover insights into the complex world of startup funding. Startups rely heavily on funding to grow and innovate, but understanding the trends and patterns in this space is critical for investors, entrepreneurs, and decision-makers. My goal was to answer important questions about how funding flows across sectors and countries and highlight successes and failures in the startup ecosystem.
